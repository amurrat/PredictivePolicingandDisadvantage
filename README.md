Abstract: 
Predictive Policing is a crime prevention strategy relying upon prior crime occurrence data to anticipate future criminal occurrences. Concerns have been raised about possible discrimination due to the method used to make predictions. The current study looks at segregation and the index of dissimularity as structural indicators of disadvantage to evaluate accusations of racial discrimination in policing technologies.
